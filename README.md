**Dock-Alloc** is a research-driven Rust project for developing a high-performance,
scalable solver for the **Berth Allocation Problem (BAP)**.
It combines modern data structures, bit-level optimization, and algorithm engineering techniques
to accelerate metaheuristic search procedures under spatio-temporal constraints.

## ðŸš¢ Problem Description

The **Berth Allocation Problem (BAP)** is a classical NP-hard problem in maritime logistics.
It involves assigning vessels to berth positions over time, taking into account:

- Vessel dimensions and arrival windows
- Berth availability and compatibility
- Operational constraints (e.g., time windows, service durations)

Solving this problem efficiently is crucial for reducing congestion and improving
throughput at container terminals.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

This project aims to:

- Develop **scalable data structures** for tracking berth occupancy in discrete timeâ€“space
- Enable **fast neighborhood generation and feasibility checks** for metaheuristics
- Support **local search** and **simulated annealing** in large-scale instances
